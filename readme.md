This is Rustman, a hangman game developed in Rust as my first Rust project.

I suggest following these instructions for [setting up Rust in Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup)

or these instructions for [setting up Rust in Linux](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

To play, do "cargo run" at the top level of the repo.
